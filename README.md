# Some test files causing issues with Titiler

The files in the repo are just intented to debug Titiler and/or rio_tiler which do not expect to receive a list of pixel types (one for each band whereas they are all the same)  
COG file causing troubles:
* s250-advanced/IMG_MSI_TCI_R60m_S2A_MSI__SGP_20220930T161339_af98.COG.TIFF

Possible linked issue: https://github.com/rasterio/rasterio/issues/2180 and this PR:  https://github.com/rasterio/rasterio/pull/1595
This also may be related to this GDAL issue: https://github.com/OSGeo/gdal/issues/2298
GDAL does not seem to handle correctly Signed Bytes (at least on version <=3.6)
Seems that the image bands are considered to have different pixels'types and returns a list. 
According to the metadata this is obviously not the case.

##Â Here's the error message I got
